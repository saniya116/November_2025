Explain the concept of Encapsulation in Java.
Answer:

Encapsulation is one of the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.
It means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.
The main idea is to protect the data from direct access by using private variables and providing controlled access through public getter and setter methods.

Encapsulation helps in:

Protecting data from unauthorized access

Maintaining security

Making the code easy to modify and maintain

Improving flexibility and reusability
