Explain the difference between while loop and for loop in Java.

Answer:
A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. The condition is checked first, and the loop runs only if the condition is true.
A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It has initialization, condition, and increment in one line, making it compact and suitable for loops with counters.
In summary, use while for uncertain iterations and for loop for fixed or count-based iterations.
