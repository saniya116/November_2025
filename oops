Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach where software is designed using objects. The 4 main concepts are:

1. Encapsulation – Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access.


2. Inheritance – One class (child) can acquire properties and methods of another class (parent).


3. Polymorphism – Same function name behaves differently in different situations (method overloading and overriding).


4. Abstraction – Showing only essential information and hiding unnecessary details from the user.
