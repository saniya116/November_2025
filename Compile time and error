Explain the difference between Compile-time
Error 
and Run-time Error.

Answer:

Compile-time errors are errors that occur when the 
program is being compiled.
Examples: syntax errors, missing semicolons, 
wrong variable types.
These errors must be fixed before the program can run.

Run-time errors occur while the program is
executing.
Examples: dividing by zero, accessing invalid 
array index, null pointer exception.
These errors stop the program 
unexpectedly during execution.
