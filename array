What are the differences between Array and ArrayList in Java?

Ans:

Array is a fixed-size data structure, while ArrayList is dynamic and can grow or shrink.

Arrays can store both primitive types and objects, whereas ArrayList stores only objects.

ArrayList provides built-in methods like add(), remove(), size(), but Arrays do not.

ArrayList is part of Java Collections Framework, but Arrays are not.
