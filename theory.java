Java Theory
Introduction
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle).
It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)” — the same Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Features of Java
1. Simple:
Easy to learn and understand. Syntax is similar to C/C++ but with fewer complexities.
2. Object-Oriented:
Everything in Java is treated as an object that contains data and methods.
3. Platform Independent:
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system with JVM.
4. Secure:
Java provides a secure runtime environment using the security manager and bytecode verifier.
5. Robust:
Java handles errors and memory management automatically using **exception
Multithreaded:
Java allows multiple threads (lightweight processes) to run simultaneously.
7. Portable:
Java programs can easily be moved from one system to another.
8. Distributed:
Java supports distributed computing using technologies like RMI and EJB.
Java Program Execution Process
1. Write code → .java file
2. Compile using javac → generates .class file (bytecode)
3. Execute using java → JVM interprets bytecode into machine code
Example:
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
Output:
Hello, Java!
Main Components of Java
1. JDK (Java Development Kit) – tools to develop Java programs.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – provides libraries and JVM to run programs.
3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – executes the bytecode.
OOP Concepts in Java
1. Class – Blueprint of an object.
2. Object – Instance of a class.
3. Encapsulation – Binding data and methods together.
4. Inheritance – One class inherits the properties of another.
5. Polymorphism – One task can be performed in different ways.
6. Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
