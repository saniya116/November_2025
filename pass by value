Theory: Pass by Value in Java
Java is always Pass by Value.
That means → When we call a method, Java sends a copy of the value, not the original variable.
So, any changes made inside the method will not affect the original value outside the method.
Example:
public class PassByValueExample {
    public static void changeValue(int x) {
        x = x + 5;  // This change happens only inside the method
        System.out.println("Inside method x = " + x);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10;
        System.out.println("Before method num = " + num);
        changeValue(num); // Passing a COPY of num
        System.out.println("After method num = " + num);
    }
}
Output:
Before method num = 10
Inside method x = 15
After method num = 10
Why this happens?
num value (10) is copied to x
Only the copy (x) is changed inside the method
So original num remains same
