Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its main principles.
Answer:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes software design around objects, 
which represent real-world entities. An object contains data (variables) and behaviour (methods). OOP helps in building programs that are more organized, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain. 
It provides a clear structure for code by grouping related properties and actions together in the form of classes and objects.
The major principles of OOP are:
1. Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods into a single unit called a class. It also restricts unauthorized access using access modifiers like private, public, and protected.
It helps in protecting data from accidental changes and improves the security of the application.
2. Inheritance:
Inheritance allows one class (child or subclass) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass). 
It supports code reusability because common functionalities need not be written again. It also helps in building hierarchical relationships among classes.
3. Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same function or method to behave differently based on the object that calls it.
It is mainly achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (run-time polymorphism). Polymorphism increases flexibility in programming.
4. Abstraction:
Abstraction hides unnecessary details from the user and only shows the essential features. 
It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. It simplifies the complexity of the system.
