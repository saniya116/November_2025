Explain Abstraction in Java. What are Abstract Classes and Interfaces? Give suitable examples.
Answer:
Abstraction is one of the most important concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
It means showing only the necessary features of an object and hiding internal implementation details from the user.
For example, when we use a mobile phone, we press buttons but we don’t know how internal circuits work.
This is abstraction — we use the functionality without knowing the complexity inside.
Why Abstraction?
Increases security by hiding background details
Reduces complexity for the user
Improves maintainability of code
Focuses on what an object does instead of how it does
Abstract Class
An abstract class is a class declared with the keyword abstract.
It may contain abstract methods (without body) and non-abstract methods (with body).
We cannot create objects of an abstract class.
Example:
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // abstract method
    void sleep() { // normal method
        System.out.println("Animals sleep");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
Here, the real implementation of sound() is decided by the subclass.
Interface
An interface is a blueprint of a class.
It contains only abstract methods (till Java 7)
From Java 8 onwards, it can also have:
default methods
static methods
A class uses implements keyword to implement an interface.
A class can implement multiple interfaces (supports multiple inheritance).
Example:
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}
class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }
}
