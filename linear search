Linear Search in Java – Theory
Definition:
Linear Search (also called Sequential Search) is the simplest searching technique.
In this method, each element in the array is compared one by one with the element to be searched (called the key).
Working Process:
1. Start from the first element of the array.
2. Compare the current element with the key.
3. If a match is found → return the index (position).
4. If not found → move to the next element.
5. If the end of the array is reached without finding the key → print “Element not found”.
Example:
Array → [10, 25, 30, 45, 50]
Key → 30
Steps:
Compare 30 with 10 → not same
Compare 30 with 25 → not same
Compare 30 with 30 → match found at index 2
Output → Element found at index 2
Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input array elements and the key
Step 3: For i = 0 to n-1
            If arr[i] == key
               Print "Element found at index i"
               Stop
Step 4: If not found, print "Element not found"
Step 5: End
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) → element found at first position
Worst Case: O(n) → element found at last or not found
Average Case: O(n)
Space Complexity:
O(1) → because no extra memory is used except variables.
