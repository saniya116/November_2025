the theory of Binary Search in Java 
Definition:
Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm used to find the position of a target element in a sorted array.
It works by dividing the search interval in half repeatedly, reducing the search space with each step.
Algorithm Steps:
1. Start with the low index = 0 and high index = n - 1.
2. Find the middle index →
mid = (low + high) / 2
3. Compare the middle element with the target element:
If arr[mid] == key → Element found ✅
If arr[mid] < key → Search the right half (low = mid + 1)
If arr[mid] > key → Search the left half (high = mid - 1)
4. Repeat steps 2–3 until the element is found or the range becomes empty.
Example:
Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Search for: 30
Step 1 → low=0, high=4, mid=2
arr[mid] = 30 → Element found at index 2 ✅
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) (element found at middle)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1) for iterative version, O(log n) for recursive version.
Important Note:
Binary Search only works on sorted arrays.
If the array is unsorted, it must be sorted before performing binary search.
Key Points:
Much faster than Linear Search for large datasets.
Uses divide and conquer technique.
Efficient and commonly used in many algorithms.
