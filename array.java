What is the difference between Array and ArrayList in Java?
An Array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type,
and its size cannot be changed once created.
An ArrayList, on the other hand, is a dynamic data structure from the Java Collections Framework
that can grow or shrink in size at runtime.
Arrays can store both primitive types and objects, whereas ArrayList can only store objects. 
ArrayList also provides built-in methods like add(), remove(), and contains() which make it more flexible than arrays.
